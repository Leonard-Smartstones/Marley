Data taken from Wearable's demo at INRS (high quality dry electrodes)

Subject: Marley
Stimulus: 8 hz, 10 hz, and 12 hz red LED flashing light controlled by Arduino
Channels: data from 20 electrodes were recorded, referenced to Pz. O1 and O2 are at index [14, 15]
Trial 1 was taken first, with 30 seconds of 8 hz, then 12 hz, then 10 hz, then baseline (eyes open). I had to bend down to stare at the light for all the recordings, which might have introduced EMG to the signal, so we decided to run another trial with the LED straight ahead.
